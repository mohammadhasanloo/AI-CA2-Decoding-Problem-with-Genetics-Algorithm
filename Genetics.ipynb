    "### Introduction\n",
    "We have two text file named `encoded_text.txt` and `global_text.txt` and we want to decrypt the encoded text by key. We don't have key and the main text. We want to find the key by using global text and finally find the main text by the key that is found by genetics algorithm and global text.\n",

    "### Description\n",
    "The cryptography used in this project is done using an encryption key and a table. To do this, a custom encryption key is first selected. A new string is then created using this key, and at the end, encrypted text is created using the encryption table.\n",
    "To start the encryption operation, a custom key is first selected and this key is repeated to the number of letters of the text that we want to encrypt. For example, if the text we want to encrypt is \"WE ARE DISCOVERED SAVE YOURSELF\" and the selected key is the word \"RUN\", the initial string that is generated will be in the next step of encryption with\n",
    "The table is used according to the following phrase:<br/>\n",
    "\"RU NRU NRUNRUNRUN RUNR UNRUNRUN\" This generated phrase is then converted to the master code string using the encryption table. This phrase is also called the key.<br/>\n",
    "The cryptographic table used in this project includes the letters of the English alphabet, which are written twice in different rows, and each alphabet is rotated one unit to the left compared to the alphabet of the previous row. For example, when B shifts to the first position in the second row, the letter A is moved to the end of the second row. Now, to convert each letter of the string calculated in the previous step to a password, the column that corresponds to the letter in the main message and the row that corresponds to the letter in the key must be selected from the intersection of the two, The password is obtained.<br/>\n",
    "The encryption key in this project has 14 letters."

      "Some recent work by E. Fermi and L. Szilard, which has been communicated to me in manuscript, leads me to expect that the element uranium may be turned into a new and important source of energy in the immediate future. Certain aspects of the situation which has arisen seem to call for watchfulness and, if necessary, quick action on the part of the Administration. I believe therefore that it is my duty to bring to your attention the following facts and recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "In the course of the last four months it has been made probableâ€”through the work of Joliot in France as well as Fermi and Szilard in Americaâ€”that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium by which vast amounts of power and large quantities of new radium-like elements would be generated. Now it appears almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate future.\n",
      "\n",
      "This phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs, and it is conceivableâ€”though much less certainâ€”that extremely powerful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed. A single bomb of this type, carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory. However, such bombs might very well prove to be too heavy for transportation by air.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United States has only very poor ores of uranium in moderate quantities. There is some good ore in Canada and the former Czechoslovakia, while the most important source of uranium is Belgian Congo.\n",
      "\n",
      "In view of this situation you may think it desirable to have some permanent contact maintained between the Administration and the group of physicists working on chain reactions in America. One possible way of achieving this might be for you to entrust with this task a person who has your confidence and who could perhaps serve in an inofficial capacity. His task might comprise the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "a)  to approach Government Departments, keep them informed of the further development, and put forward recommendations for Government action, giving particular attention to the problem of securing a supply of uranium ore for the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "b)  to speed up the experimental work, which is at present being carried on within the limits of the budgets of University laboratories, by providing funds, if such funds be required, through his contacts with private persons who are willing to make contributions for this cause, and perhaps also by obtaining the co-operation of industrial laboratories which have the necessary equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand that Germany has actually stopped the sale of uranium from the Czechoslovakian mines which she has taken over. That she should have taken such early action might perhaps be understood on the ground that the son of the German Under-Secretary of State, von Weizsacker, is attached to the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut in Berlin where some of the American work on uranium is now being repeated.\n",

    "### Q1: What problems do very small or very large initial populations cause?\n",
    "If the population size is too large, it takes too much time for each population to perform various operations such as crossover, mutation, etc and in fact the efficiency of the algorithm decreases and creates problems for fitness.<br/>\n",
    "If the population is very small, our state space is very limited, and in fact the amount we initially quantify is limited to the same space, and the choises will be limited to much to initialized population at first step\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2: If the number of population increases in each period, what effect will it have on the accuracy and speed of the algorithm?\n",
    "By doing this, the further we go, we have to calculate the fitness for more chromosomes, and the algorithm takes more time, the more it goes, we get close to better answers, and our fitness is likely to get better. Making a new chromosome is likely to be added with low fitness, which according to the algorithm either does not affect the final answer or causes it to move away from the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3: Why are both crossovers and mutations used in genetic algorithms? What problem might occur if any of them are not used?\n",
    "In the genetic algorithm for crossover operation, it is used to combine different answers to reach new answers that are derived from the previous answers. Mutation operation is used to change different genes in different chromosomes to achieve new and random genes from the domain and make small changes in chromosomes so that we do not get stuck in certain genes. If there is no crossover operation, the previous answers are repeated continuously, and only mutation can not make a lot of change and we do not get new answers. If we do not use mutauion, we may get stuck in a range of genes and fail to reach final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4: Which crossover and mutation operations are more effective in increasing accuracy? Which one makes this impact faster?\n",
    "I think crossover is more effective in increasing accuracy and it impacts faster in this property.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5: with using crossover and mutation methods, the population may still not change after a few steps. How can this problem be eliminated?\n",
    "We can increase MUTATION_PROBABILITY and CROSSOVER_PROBABILITY to increase the state space\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6: If only one of the crossover and mutation methods were to be used, which one do you think would be more effective? Why?\n",
    "I think crossover is more effective. Because it make new chromosomes and we can make uniform crossover that the change's rate will be higher than mutation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7: What do you think are the solutions to get a quick answer to this particular problem?\n",
    "We can change the hyperparameters like `POPULATION_NUM`, `SAMPLE_NUM`, `MUTATION_PROBABILITY` and `CROSS_OVER_PROBABILITY`. We can use different values for these variables to find a faster way"
